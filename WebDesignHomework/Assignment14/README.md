# Assignment 14 – Happy Tails Website

This assignment expands my "Happy Tails" pet adoption website from last week.

## 1. 3+ Pages (Multi-Page Website with Navigation)
I have four full pages: index.html, about.html, adopt.html, and contact.html. They are all linked properly and have navigation to eachother.

## 2. Framework Integration (Bootstrap)
I added the Bootstrap 5 CSS and JS CDN links to all the pages. I then used Bootstrap’s style on headers, buttons, forms, and layout sections. I think this makes it feel more whole and very professional all around.

## 3. Framework Styling Elements
I used buttons, a navigation bar, and other elements to keep it consistent while also making my interactivity and layout better overall.

## 4. HTML5 Canvas
I created a canvas that should draw an animated paw print using JavaScript on the about.html. I did this because it adds a cool element to the page that is actual in the code not an image.

## 5. JavaScript Functionality
I made it so the required field tage will pop up for users for needed firlds that were left empty. I added the javascript because it helped imrpove my pages and was needed for the paw animation.
