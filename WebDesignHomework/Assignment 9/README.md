# How to Clean Dirty Sneakers

## Materials Needed:
- Soap or detergent (mild)
- Warm water
- Toothbrush (for scrubbing)
- Microfiber cloth or towel
- Sneaker cleaner or specialized shoe cleaning product (optional)
- Magic eraser (for stubborn marks)
- Baking soda (for deodorizing)
- Mesh bag (if using washing machine method)
- Laundry detergent (if using washing machine method)

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Remove Laces and Insoles
Remove the laces from your sneakers and set them aside. If your sneakers have removable insoles, take them out and set them aside as well.

### Step 2: Brush Off Dirt and Debris
Use a dry toothbrush or a soft brush to remove loose dirt, mud, or debris from the surface of the shoes. Be gentle to avoid damaging the material.

### Step 3: Prepare Cleaning Solution
Mix warm water with a small amount of mild soap or detergent. If you have a sneaker cleaner, you can use it instead of soap. Use a microfiber cloth to dip into the soapy water, wring it out, and gently clean the shoes.

### Step 4: Scrub the Shoes
Using the toothbrush, scrub the shoes to remove dirt from seams, soles, and other areas where grime builds up. For stubborn stains, you can use a magic eraser. If your shoes are especially dirty, you may need to repeat this step.

### Step 5: Rinse and Wipe
Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away any soap or detergent from the shoes. Be careful not to soak them too much, especially if they are made of delicate materials.

### Step 6: Dry the Sneakers
Stuff the sneakers with paper towels or newspaper to help them keep their shape while drying. Let them air dry in a well-ventilated area, but avoid direct sunlight as it can cause fading. Do not use a dryer, as it could damage the material.


## How to Wash Your Shoes in a Washing Machine (Optional)

Sometimes using a washing machine might be a faster way to clean your sneakers, but it can be harder on the shoes and might ruin them if not done properly. To wash your sneakers in the machine:

1. Remove the laces and insoles.
2. Place your shoes in a mesh bag to protect them during the wash cycle.
3. Use a gentle wash cycle with cold water and a small amount of detergent.
4. Air dry the shoes (do not put them in the dryer).

## Additional Tips:
- **Stain Removal:** For stubborn stains, use a magic eraser or sneaker-specific cleaner.
- **Deodorizing:** To keep your shoes smelling fresh, sprinkle some baking soda inside the shoes overnight, then shake it out the next morning.
- **Waterproofing:** Consider applying a waterproofing spray to help protect your sneakers from future dirt and stains.
