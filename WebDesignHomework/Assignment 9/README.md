# How to Clean Dirty Sneakers

## Materials Needed:
- Soap or detergent 
- Warm water
- Toothbrush (for scrubbing)
- Microfiber cloth or towel
- Sneaker cleaner or specialized shoe cleaning product (optional)
- Magic eraser (for stubborn marks)
- Baking soda (for deodorizing)
- Mesh bag (if using washing machine method)
- Laundry detergent (if using washing machine method)

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Remove Laces and Insoles
Remove the laces from your sneakers and set them aside. I suggest that you remove the insoles and set them aside as well.

### Step 2: Brush Off Dirt and Debris
Use a dry toothbrush or a soft brush to remove loose dirt, mud, or debris from the surface of the shoes. Be gentle to avoid damaging the material.

### Step 3: Prepare Cleaning Solution
Mix warm water with a small amount of mild soap or detergent. If you have a sneaker cleaner, you can use it instead of soap. Use a microfiber cloth to dip into the soapy water, wring it out, and gently clean the shoes.

### Step 4: Scrub the Shoes
Using the toothbrush, scrub the shoes to remove dirt from seams, soles, and other areas where grime builds up. For stubborn stains, you can use a magic eraser. If your shoes are especially dirty I would suggest to repeat this step until you are happy with it.

### Step 5: Rinse and Wipe
Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away any soap or detergent from the shoes. Be careful not to soak them too much, especially if they are made of delicate materials.

### Step 6: Dry the Sneakers
Stuff the sneakers with paper towels or newspaper to help them keep their shape while drying. Let them air dry in an open area, but avoid direct sunlight because it can cause fading. No matter what do not use the dryer I have done this before and it does not turn out good.


## How to Wash Your Shoes in a Washing Machine (Optional)


1. Remove the laces and insoles.
2. Place your shoes in a mesh bag to protect them during the wash cycle.
3. Use a gentle wash cycle with cold water and a small amount of detergent.
4. Air dry the shoes.



## Additional Tips:
- **Stain Removal:** For stubborn stains, I like to use a magic eraser or sneaker specific cleaners.
- **Deodorizing:** To keep my shoes smelling new I sprinkle some baking soda inside the shoes overnight, then shake it out the next morning.
- **Waterproofing:** Consider applying a waterproofing spray to help protect your sneakers from future dirt and stains.
