        <hr />
            <p>Travel is something I believe makes or breaks a person's mental well-being. Without it, you can feel trapped in a never-ending routine of boredom and work. It is the perfect way to discover who you really are!</p>

        <h2 style="width: 45%; float: left">Dream Destinations</h2>  
            <p>Being in college can make traveling the world challenging, but I have a list of dream destinations I hope to see in the future.</p>
                    
                <h3>Things I Want to See:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Colosseum:</strong> Standing in this historic site would be breathtaking. From its history to its architecture, I want to experience it all.</li>
                        <li><strong>Christ the Redeemer:</strong> A symbol of faith and grandeur, seeing this iconic statue in person would be deeply meaningful to me.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mount Rushmore:</strong> Surprisingly, I haven't visited this yet, but it's on my list!</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Favorite Places I Have Been:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Planet Hollywood Cancun:</strong> This was my senior trip destination, and it was an unforgettable experience with great service, food, and entertainment!</li>
                        <li><strong>Disneyland:</strong> I went when I was young, but I still remember the magic (and the price tag). Definitely want to go again!</li>
                        <li><strong>Disney World:</strong> Not my favorite—too much travel time between parks, and everything felt spread out.</li>
                        <li><strong>Silverwood:</strong> An underrated amusement park! Affordable, with both a water park and roller coasters, making it a perfect weekend getaway.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cabo, Mexico:</strong> The beaches, the food, the scenery—Cabo is hands down one of the most beautiful places in Mexico.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>These are just a few of my travel experiences. I plan to continue adding to this list as I explore more of the world...</p> 
                    
                <p>I feel incredibly fortunate to have traveled as much as I have, but the desire to see more never fades!</p>
