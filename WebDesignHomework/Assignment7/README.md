# Reflection
- I am most proud of my new suggestion system on my Destinations page as well as the overall colors that I have used to create my travel log. I believe that the colors help give the user a welcoming and loose feel that shows fun rather than strictness. As for the suggestion system it improves functionalilty as well as interactment between me and the users to help find new destinations!
- Everything is going good, I am becoming more and more confident in this as we go. Thank you for the support and patience you have for me and this process as a whole!
