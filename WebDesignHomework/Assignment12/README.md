# Project Overview

For this project, I worked on the gallery.html page for the sneaker site.

## 6 Techniques

1. Sizing- I controlled the width and height of images of the gallery to make a neat display.
2. Border- I added rounded borders to the shoe gallery images.
3. Margin- Created some space between the navigation links and sections using margins.
4. Padding- I used padding inside the navigation and gallery content for better spacing.
5. Display- I tried the Flexbox and Grid layouts to organize my images but I don't think I likey this look entirley compared to the old layoput of the photos.
6. Overflow- Managed overflow with my display and added overflow my gallery pictures to make sure the images stayed neat to the boundries.
