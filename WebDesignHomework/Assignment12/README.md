# Project Overview

For this project, I worked on the gallery.html page for the sneaker site.

## 6 Techniques

-Sizing: I controlled the width and height of images of the gallery to make a neat display.
-Border: I added rounded borders to the shoe gallery images.
-Margin: Created some space between the navigation links and sections using margins.
-Padding: I used padding inside the navigation and gallery content for better spacing.
-Display: I tried the Flexbox and Grid layouts to organize my images but I don't think I likey this look entirley compared to the old layoput of the photos.
-Overflow: Managed overflow with my display and added overflow my gallery pictures to make sure the images stayed neat to the boundries.
