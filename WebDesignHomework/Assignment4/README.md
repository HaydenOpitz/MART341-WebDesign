## How Web Browsers Function
Web browsers retrieve and display web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. When you use a URL, the browser changes it into an IP address using DNS, then gets the page from the server with HTTP or HTTPS. After that the server responds with the needed files that the browser defines to build the DOM, apply styles, and execute scripts. The last thing is that the browser renders the page on screen to allow things like clicking and scrolling to update content. 

## What is the DOM?
DOM or the Document Object Model is a structured format of a webpage that browsers create from HTML. In addition, it organizes the page where each element such as div, h1, or p becomes a node. Also, JavaScript interacts with the DOM to change elements and enable updates like changing text, colors, or displaying content. CSS styles the DOM to control the visual appearance which makes the web page interactive and visually appealing to users like me. 

## HTML, XML, XHTML - Differences
HTML is the basic language for structuring web pages. It is designed to be flexible and easy with errors. XML is used for storing and transporting data and requires formatting with properly closed tags. And with XHTML, it is an even more strict version of HTML that follows XML rules and needs  well formed code for better consistency. Another difference between them is that both XML and XHTML are case-sensitive and require precision and making them more structured but harder to use unlike HTML.
