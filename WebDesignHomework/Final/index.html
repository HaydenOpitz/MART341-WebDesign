    <h2>Skills Improved</h2>
    <p>I definitely improved on my programming the most from all the new techniques throughout each weekly assignment to the endless struggle that I had in the beginning learning GitHub.  I also really improved on my aesthetic approach and learning how to organize my content, so it actually looks professional.</p>

    <h2>Transferable Skills</h2>
    <p>I improved on problem solving from really struggling at first with my coding. It was my first time doing coding this advanced and was definitely overwhelming until I kept working and got the hang as I went along. In addition, I was able to expand on my creativity and my ability to show a message within my site itself.</p>

    <h2>Web Presence</h2>
    <p>I built many websites throughout this course that experimenting with my different interests and built on each of them throughout the weeks. The sites I created include the idea website, which was my first, my travel log, a sneaker cleaning tutorial site, my animal shelter website, and this one that you are on right now.</p>
    <p>The strategies that helped me maintain and improve these sites were changing layouts, texts, colors, text, styling, and other similar things that kept the site looking new and fresh each week. As for the planning, I would look at the assignment at hand and brainstorm what I want the site to become once I am done, I would consistently check as I went and always double checked if my plan was where I wanted it to be when I was done.</p>
