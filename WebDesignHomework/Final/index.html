    <h2>Skills Improved</h2>
    <p>I definitely improved on my programming the most from all the new techniques throughout each weekly assignment due to the endless struggle that I had in the beginning of learning GitHub.  I also really improved on my aesthetic approach and learning how to organize my stuff so it actually looks professional.</p>

    <h2>Transferable Skills</h2>
    <p>I improved on problem solving from really struggling at first with my coding. It was my first time doing coding this advanced and it was definitely overwhelming until I kept working and finally got the hang of it. In addition, I was able to get better in my creativity and my ability to show a message with my site itself.</p>

    <h2>Web Presence</h2>
    <p>I built many websites throughout this course that went over my different interests and were built on throughout the weeks. The sites I created include the idea website, which was my first, my travel log, a sneaker cleaning tutorial site, my animal shelter website, and this one that you are on right now.</p>
    <p>The strategies that helped me maintain and improve these sites were changing layouts, texts, colors, text, styling, and other similar things that kept the site looking new and fresh each week. As for the planning, I would look at the assignment for the week and brainstorm what I wanted the site to become. Once I was done, I would always double checked if my plan was where I wanted it to be when I was done.</p>
