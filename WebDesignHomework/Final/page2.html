    <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
    <p>Throughout the semester I mostly used HTML tags like &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; to keep my structure clean and easy to look at. For the CSS, I styled hero sections with background images and embedded videos, customized fonts, and added a simple footers. Finally, I used responsive techniques with Bootstrap, grids, navbar, and interactive tables for the user to use themselves.</p>
    <p>I’m mostly proud of how my sites work on both phones and computers. The layouts adjust smoothly thanks to things like Bootstrap. I also like the clean look of my hero sections with images and bold text. And of course, I love my readable fonts and spacing that I learned from this course.</p>

    <h2>Tools & Frameworks</h2>
    <p>I used pretty much every tool possible for this course. From GitHub, Visual Studio Code, some Bootstrap, Pixabay for free pictures, and GitHub Desktop. They all provided something different and useful in their own ways, and I am glad I was able to learn how to interlink them.</p>
    <p>These tools made everything much more organized and not to mention much faster in the process of doing my assignments. I didn’t have to worry about overlapping or losing my content at any time and I believe that helped me the most in my workflow.</p>

    <h2>Creative Thinking</h2>
    <p>This semester, I used creative design by keeping my layouts simple. I usually chose fonts that were already in the platform and colors that matched each site's mood. Finally, I tried to make every site accessible for all users!</p>
    <p>There were some moments of inspiration for me this semester that came mostly from the discussion post assignments. Whether it was me researching professional websites like Nike and how they use different techniques or my peers providing feedback that I could use for my assignment in the class. All of them greatly helped me and I thank you guys for that!</p>
