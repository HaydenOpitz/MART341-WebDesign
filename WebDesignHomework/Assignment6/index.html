    <!-- Introduction section about travel -->
    <p>Travel is something I believe makes or breaks a personals mental well being. Without it you can feel trapped and stuck in a never ending routine of boredom and work. It is the perfect way to find who you really are! </p>

    <h2 style="width: 100%; float: left">Future travel Dreams</h2>  
    <p>Being in college is a struggle in many ways especially when it comes to traveling the world. Here are some of my dream spots and things I want to see for myself whenever I get the chance.</p>

    
    <h3>Things I Want to See:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Colosseum:</strong> Being in this splace would be one of the most amazing things ever. From the hostory, markings, and beauty behind the creation, I want to see it all.</li>
        <li><strong>Christ the Redeemer:</strong> This is a main focus towards my beliefs and religion as to see one of the largest statues in the world in the form of Christ is truley a dream of mine.</li>
        <li><strong>Mount Rushmore:</strong>I feel like this should be one thats marled off my list already but still havent gotten around to this one.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Favorite Places I Have Been:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Planet Holleywood Cancun: This was my senior trip spot and we all had a blast with great service and people all around for an entire wek straight!</li>
        <li>Walt DisneyLand: Went when I was pretty younger but still remember how amazing (but expensive) this place was. Definetly would want to go again soon!</li>
        <li>Walt Disney World: Honestly not my favorite spot. It was too much travel time between worlds and felt like they were all too far apart from one another. </li>
        <li>Silverwood: Honestly this place is very underrated, it is cheap for having a water park and amusment park all in one and is my go to spot for a quick weekend trip with friends.</li>
        <li>Cabo, Mexico: Was a great time from the beach, local shops, to the local food. I would say this is the most beautiful part of Mexico all together!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These are just a few of what I have seen and plan to continue to add to this list as I explore the world further...</p> 
                    
    <p>I am blessed to be in the position I am to have traveled so much in my life already, but it is an itch that cannot stop itching!</p>
