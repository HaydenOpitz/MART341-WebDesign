# **Hello!n**

## *My name is Hayden*

*The course is going good for me so far besides a couple tech issues running all these new websites.* **I am ready to continue learning about these files and the journey ahead into making complex working business websites!** The only thing that you could help support me directly is that it would really help if you made the assignments pop up on our dashboard timeline on Canvas to better help me stay on track.
