# Project Overview

I worked on my: **index.html** for my Sneaker Cleaning Guide website that I made for last weeks assignment.

## Required Techniques

- **External CSS**: I linked to index.html for organized styling by creating the style.css.
- **Class Selector**: Used for sections like .step to style each cleaning step like background, padding, and the border.
- **ID Selector**: I applied it to #materials-section to specifically style the materials list with a border and background color.

## Additional Techniques

- **Background Colors**: I used different colors for sections and created a neat format that is simple but clean.
- **Font Colors**: Contrasting white for the header/nav text and darker text for the body text to ensure readability.
- **Positioning**: I used a structured layout that I applied to the body for vertical arrangement of the video and steps and to ensure the content section grows and fills available space.
- **Text Alignment**: I used a centered alignment for the header and nav text to create a clean, balanced look.
- **Borders**: Added the dotted border around the #materials-section to separate it visually from the rest of the content and show that it should be the first thing you look at.
