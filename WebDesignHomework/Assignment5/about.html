<h1> Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>
<h2>Small Busniess Website</h2>
<p>For a small business site I want to build on my already established summer business
    titled Grizzly Heading Restoration. <br />I want this to be a serious tone<br /> that makes my
business more profitable and reach more customers. This would also help to grow my ability to 
produce these types of websites and design layouts.</p>
<h2>Travel Journal</h2>
<p>The idea of this travel website would have to be taken into action during in the summer
    and when I graduate college and pursue my dream of traveling. <br />This would be a more 
    playful idea that shows my journeys to the world.<br /> It could be a simple yet expensive website
    as a whole!</p>
<h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
<p>For this third website I want to create a way to market myself and create opportunities in my future
    career. This would be a professional and serious tone of my work experience, dreams, and life all together.
    Have a feeling this is the one I want to learn and pursue.</p>
