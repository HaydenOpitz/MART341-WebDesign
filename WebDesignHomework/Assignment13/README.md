# Techniques Used:
At Least 4 Pages – I created a index.html (home), about.html, contact.html, and adopt.html.

Responsive Design - I used the following three to create a responsive design that links and works properly.

Media Queries – I used my css file to format all screens properly and keep a neat layout no matter what.

Navigation Menu – I added a navigation menu at the top of all four pages that is formatted in the middle and gives an organized look overall.

Dropdown Menu – I added a dropdown menu on my adopt page with dogs, cats, and other snimals for the section names. I plan to expand on these categories so the links will actually take you to diffent depths of the page.
