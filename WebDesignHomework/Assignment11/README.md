# Project Overview

For this project, I worked on the about.html page for my Sneaker Cleaning website. The goal was to create a more clean and easy to read layout while using various CSS techniques to better interactivity and the overall design.

## Required Techniques

1. **Created a page with an external CSS stylesheet**  
   The about.html page I used an external style.css stylesheet for easy maintenance and for clean and focused on content for my about info.
   
2. **Added hover effects to enhance interactivity**  
   I used hover effects on the navigation links to improve user engagement. When hovering over the top, the background color changes and they are underlined, I think this makes  the user click through the navigation better and honestly I like the look of it a lor more now.

3. **Used an external font that is self-hosted**  
   I self hosted the **Open Sans** font by using the @font-face rule. This took be absolutley forvever but I do think it keeps the website's font consistent, even if the user does not have the font installed for themselves.

4. **Used an external font from a font library**  
   I tried to use the **Anton** font from Google Fonts for the header text (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) for the page titles.

## Additional Techniques

1. **Experimented with different font styles**  
   For me adding variety to the typography, I used **Anton** for headings and **Open Sans** for the body text. 

2. **Used text-decoration to add underlines**  
   I added an underline to the navigation links as a hover effect. I think this makes it way more professonial and is honestly very cool that it does it on its own.

3. **Applied box-shadow for visual depth**  
   I applied a box shadow effect to create more depth and give the page a better look. I think this helps break up the content and makes it visually engaging.

4. **Adjusted spacing for readability**  
   I increased the letter spacing of the navigation and header text which I think gives the text a cleaner and more open feel, especially on wider screens.

5. **Used flexible layouts with Flexbox**  
   The layout for the about.html page is arranged using Flexbox which I think is a great design that changes to different screen sizes and ensures elements stay aligned.

6. **Aligned text and elements for a clean layout**  
   I used **center alignment** for the header and navigation to make it feel better and organized.

7. **Highlighted specific content with custom classes**  
   I created a custom .highlight class to show specific words, such as leather, suede, and canvas on the site. I wanted to point out the more important exampeks of the things that I was saying in my about section.
