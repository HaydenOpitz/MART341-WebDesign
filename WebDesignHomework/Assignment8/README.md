# Assignment 8 - Travel Tips Website

## Techniques Used

### Div (at least 2):
I used divs to group the travel tips and media content for better organization. One div is used for the travel tips section, and another div is used to group the embedded YouTube video and Google Map together.

### Span (at least 2):
I used spans to highlight important phrases like "roll method" and "street food" in the travel tips. This draws attention to key advice and makes the content more engaging.

### Audio (at least 1):
I used an audio element to embed relaxing travel music that users can play while reading the tips. The audio player includes controls to play and pause the music. (I think I did this right not completeley sure though.)

### Video (at least 1):
I used an iframe to embed a YouTube video on travel safety tips. This allows users to watch the video directly on the page.

### Iframe (at least 1):
I used an iframe to embed a Google Map showing a popular destination. This gives users an interactive way to explore the location.

### Class (at least 2):
I used the class `highlight` to style key phrases in the text and `media` to structure and style the media sections (audio and video). These classes help maintain consistency across the page.

### Escape Character (at least 1):
I used the escape character '&copy;' in my footer statement.
